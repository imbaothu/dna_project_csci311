## Project Information
This is a progam that examines different sequences of DNA for the sequence with the most in common with the target, and returns the most common sequence. This program utilizes four different algorithms to find the most common DNA sequences
given a query and sequences. 

## How to Run
Open the file dna_project.py and enter the name of the query and sequences file you would like to compare. Since we have 
four queries, you can select between longest common substring, longest common subsequence, edit distance, and the Needleman-
Wunsch algorithm. Select 1 for Longest common subsequence, 2 for longest common substring, 3 for Needleman-Wunsch,4 for edit distance, and 5 to run all 4 of them. 

## Output
The output will show the scores computed for each corresponding algorithm that is chosen. The results summary prints out the most similar sequence using the current algorithm and prints out the organism that the query is most similar to.
